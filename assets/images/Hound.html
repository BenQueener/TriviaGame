<p><i>In the early years of the <a href="/wiki/Great_War_(G1)" title="Great War (G1)">Great War</a> on <a href="/wiki/Cybertron_(planet)" title="Cybertron (planet)">Cybertron</a>, Hound was serving alongside <a href="/wiki/Tempest_(G1)" title="Tempest (G1)">Tempest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pulsar_(G1)" title="Pulsar (G1)">Pulsar</a> under <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Optimus Prime (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Optimus Prime</a> shortly before he was made overall Autobot leader by the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Autobot_Elders" title="Council of Autobot Elders">High Council</a>.</i> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/And_There_Shall_Come...a_Leader!" title="And There Shall Come...a Leader!">And There Shall Come...a Leader!</a></span> Hound was a part of the crew on board the <a href="/wiki/Ark_(G1)" title="Ark (G1)">Ark</a> when it crashed into <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> four million years ago while clearing an asteroid field in the path of Cybertron. Upon reviving in <a href="/wiki/1984" title="1984">1984</a>, Hound marveled at this world's strange and diverse lifeforms, and couldn't wait to explore its surface—not for business, but for pleasure. However, Optimus Prime cautioned him, reminding Hound that their primary purpose was to spare Earth's inhabitants from the onslaught of the Decepticons. Hound was chosen as part of the first field expedition into the world under <a href="/wiki/Prowl_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Prowl (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Prowl</a>'s command, and his new surroundings overwhelmed him. His sensors alerted them to a <a href="/wiki/Community_Drive-In" title="Community Drive-In">drive-in movie theatre</a>, a serene scene that quickly turned into a battle when the Decepticons arrived. Hound was able to divert <a href="/wiki/Ravage_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Ravage (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Ravage</a>, though Hound worried more about <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Bumblebee (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Bumblebee</a>'s whereabouts, as the small scout had gone missing. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Transformers_(issue)" title="The Transformers (issue)">The Transformers</a></span>
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Tellhimwhodefeatedyouthisday.jpg" class="image"><img alt="(thumbnail)" src="/mediawiki/images2/thumb/1/17/Tellhimwhodefeatedyouthisday.jpg/200px-Tellhimwhodefeatedyouthisday.jpg" width="200" height="192" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Tellhimwhodefeatedyouthisday.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/mediawiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>"Ravage, who defeated you this day?!"<br /> "Uh, the guy that Jazz keeps getting colored as, I think?"</div></div></div>
<p>Fortunately, Bumblebee was later able to radio his location to Hound, who informed the other Autobots. Better still, he had located a <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">human</a> who could convert Earth fuel into a substance they could use! Hound and the others traveled to the home (and auto repair shop) of <a href="/wiki/Sparkplug_Witwicky" title="Sparkplug Witwicky">Sparkplug Witwicky</a>, where they were, of course, attacked again by the Decepticons! <a href="/wiki/Sideswipe_(G1)" title="Sideswipe (G1)">Sideswipe</a> apologized for leaping in front of Hound to get closer to their enemies, but Hound was fine with it so long as Decepticons were destroyed one way or the other. Unfortunately, the Decepticons left the battle with their prize, Sparkplug Witwicky, in the hopes that the human could convert fuel for them instead! <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Power_Play!" title="Power Play!">Power Play!</a></span>
</p><p>The battle left Hound and Sideswipe low on fuel, so Optimus Prime offered to carry the two home inside his trailer. After Hound had been attended to, he and the other Autobots met with the amazing <a href="/wiki/Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>, who offered to help them rescue Sparkplug from the Decepticons' <a href="/wiki/Fortress_Sinister" title="Fortress Sinister">cliffside headquarters</a>. Hound drove Spider-Man past the Earth military blockade himself with Spider-Man posing as his driver, but Hound stayed behind to help draw the Decepticons' fire while Spider-Man and <a href="/wiki/Gears_(G1)" title="Gears (G1)">Gears</a> slipped into the headquarters. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_War!" title="Prisoner of War!">Prisoner of War!</a></span>
</p><p><i>Following this, he was present when the Autobots countered the Decepticons when the latter attacked the <a href="/wiki/Sherman_Dam" title="Sherman Dam">Sherman Dam</a>, hoping to steal its energy. At Prime's order, Hound submerged into the water to locate the source of the dam's problems and found <a href="/wiki/Rumble_(G1)" title="Rumble (G1)">Rumble</a>. After a fight between the two, Hound was blasted out of the water by Rumble's piledrivers. The sight of this distracted Optimus Prime during his fight with <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Megatron (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Megatron</a> atop the dam, and Megatron was able to use this distraction to knock Prime from the dam.</i> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Decepticon_Dam-Busters!" title="Decepticon Dam-Busters!">Decepticon Dam-Busters!</a></span> <i>Back at the Ark, Hound alerted Optimus Prime to an imminent Decepticon attack.</i> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Last_Ark" title="Raiders of the Last Ark">Raiders of the Last Ark</a></span>
</p><p>When Hound was next seen, he was hanging from the ceiling of the Ark with the other Autobots, the work of the evil Decepticon <a href="/wiki/Shockwave_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Shockwave (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Shockwave</a>, who had returned and taken leadership of the Decepticons for himself. <a href="/wiki/Buster_Witwicky_(G1)" title="Buster Witwicky (G1)">Buster Witwicky</a> was shocked to discover this terrible development, and the human returned to tell <a href="/wiki/Ratchet_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Ratchet (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Ratchet</a>, the sole Autobot survivor. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_New_Order" title="The New Order">The New Order</a></span> Ratchet was eventually able to restore the Ark to the Autobots after outwitting Megatron, and Hound and the others were repaired. However, Optimus Prime's head was still in the hands of the Decepticons. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/DIS-Integrated_Circuits!" title="DIS-Integrated Circuits!">DIS-Integrated Circuits!</a></span>
</p><p>Hound's next mission involved stopping <a href="/wiki/Soundwave_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Soundwave (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Soundwave</a> from sending a message to the Decepticons back on <a href="/wiki/Cybertron_(planet)" title="Cybertron (planet)">Cybertron</a>, but matters were complicated when they faced the newly created <a href="/wiki/Constructicon_(G1)" title="Constructicon (G1)">Constructicons</a>. Their merging into the mighty <a href="/wiki/Devastator_(G1)" title="Devastator (G1)">Devastator</a> did not help things, either, but thanks to help from <a href="/wiki/Bomber_Bill" title="Bomber Bill">Bomber Bill</a>, a human trucker, the communications array was destroyed before the entire message could be sent. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Next_Best_Thing_to_Being_There!" title="The Next Best Thing to Being There!">The Next Best Thing to Being There!</a></span>

<p>The conversations of Shockwave's Decepticons, stationed at <a href="/wiki/Blackrock_Aerospace_Assembly_Plant_Number_One" title="Blackrock Aerospace Assembly Plant Number One">Blackrock Aerospace Assembly Plant Number One</a>, were being listened in on by Hound and the other Autobots, and so they overheard Shockwave's plans to dispose of Prime's head now that he was no longer useful to them. Hound led a long Autobot convoy out to rescue their leader, <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Brainstorm!" title="Brainstorm!">Brainstorm!</a></span> and headed to the swamp where Shockwave planned to dump Prime's head. They were able to form a human-chain to rescue the head from sinking to the bottom of it, but when the head was placed on Optimus Prime's body, it attacked them. This was not the real head of Optimus Prime, but an imposter head controlled by Shockwave! A group of Decepticons led by Soundwave joined the imposter Optimus Prime in destroying them, but during the course of battle the real head was restored and the Decepticons defeated. Hound was one of the few Autobots left standing. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Time!" title="Prime Time!">Prime Time!</a></span>

<p><i>Now that Prime and the <a href="/wiki/Matrix_of_Leadership" title="Matrix of Leadership">Creation Matrix</a> had been returned to them, Hound was one of the Autobots who opposed using the Matrix to create <a href="/wiki/Ultimate_Autobot" title="Ultimate Autobot">super-warriors</a>. Soon after, he assisted <a href="/wiki/Mirage_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Mirage (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Mirage</a> in capturing Ravage, who had been spying on the Autobots' debate. But Ravage's capture was part of the Decepticon's plan; once Ravage learned what he wanted to know, he escaped. Hound learned of the spy's departure when Optimus demanded to know why he was still in the base instead of chasing Ravage down; Bumblebee had been tasked with telling Hound of their prisoner's escape, but had opted to try and recapture Ravage himself! The Autobots learned that Bumblebee in turn had gotten himself captured, and Optimus was the one who ultimately retrieved him. His sense of self rejuvenated by the experience, Prime announced before Hound and the others that he had settled on not creating super-warriors, and that the debate was closed.</i> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Crisis_of_Command!" title="Crisis of Command!">Crisis of Command!</a></span> <i>When the rogue <a href="/wiki/Swoop_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Swoop (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Swoop</a>, under the control of the human <a href="/wiki/Peter_Anthony_Morris" title="Peter Anthony Morris">Professor Morris</a>, attacked the Ark, it fell to Hound and <a href="/wiki/Huffer_(G1)" title="Huffer (G1)">Huffer</a> to give him the "old Autobot one-two". It worked, though upon recovering his mind, Swoop flew away. Following him to a <a href="/wiki/Roxxon_Oil" title="Roxxon Oil">Roxxon Oil</a> facility, Hound and the other Autobots found the Dinobot lucid—for all of about two seconds before his primary <a href="/wiki/Cybo-dendron" title="Cybo-dendron">cybo-dendrons</a>, damaged after four million years in a tar pit, finally burned out and he attacked them again. With the assistance of Morris and his <a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=Neural_relay_link&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Neural relay link (page does not exist)">neural relay link</a>, they were able to subdue Swoop and return him to the Ark for treatment.</i> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Icarus_Theory" title="The Icarus Theory">The Icarus Theory</a></span>

</p><p><i>Hound watched Megatron and Shockwave battling in a <a href="/wiki/Wyoming_base" title="Wyoming base">coal mine</a> on a monitor at the Ark. When he asked if Optimus had seen it, Prime replied that it was in hand and that Bumblebee was keeping an eye on the situation.</i> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Second_Generation!" title="Second Generation!">Second Generation!</a></span>
</p><p><i>When <a href="/wiki/Galvatron_(G1)" title="Galvatron (G1)">Galvatron</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cyclonus_(G1)" title="Cyclonus (G1)">Cyclonus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scourge_(G1)" title="Scourge (G1)">Scourge</a> made their time-jump to <a href="/wiki/1986" title="1986">1986</a>, Optimus Prime, Ratchet and Prowl were lost in <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">Limbo</a>. Suspecting Decepticon involvement, Hound and <a href="/wiki/Jazz_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Jazz (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Jazz</a> were sent to spy on their foes. Cyclonus discovered the spying Autobots and attacked, taking out Jazz and beating Hound within an inch of his life while expositing about his <a href="/wiki/Life_Spark" title="Life Spark">past self</a>. Only the arrival of <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Magnus_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Ultra Magnus (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Ultra Magnus</a> saved Hound.</i>

<p><i>After getting a lift back to the Ark from Magnus, Hound tried several times to get Ultra Magnus to assist the Autobots against Galvatron; he also defended their strategy of allying with Megatron. Hound was part of the raiding party which captured Scourge, though he took a critical view of <a href="/wiki/Jetfire_(G1)" title="Jetfire (G1)">Jetfire</a>'s tactics, especially as the Autobots were beaten again and again.</i> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Target:_2006" title="Target: 2006">Target: 2006</a></span>

<p><i>In the wake of Galvatron's trip from the future, Optimus Prime faked his death to teach the Autobots how to survive without him.

</p><p>Some time after, he and the other Autobots answered a distress call from Buster Witwicky, but when they arrived to rescue him, they were attacked by both Earth-based Decepticon armies. Hound was pounced upon by <a href="/wiki/Weirdwolf_(G1)" title="Weirdwolf (G1)">Weirdwolf</a>.
</p><p>The battle was discovered to be a ruse by <a href="/wiki/Starscream_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Starscream (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Starscream</a> to cover his efforts to claim the powers of the <a href="/wiki/Underbase" title="Underbase">Underbase</a>.

<p>Later revived through unknown means, Hound joined <a href="/wiki/Grimlock_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Grimlock (G1)/Marvel Comics continuity">Grimlock</a>'s unit in leaving Cybertron to find new conflicts and fought against the <a href="/wiki/Outpost_B-67_exo-structuring_party" title="Outpost B-67 exo-structuring party">technoforming fleets</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Cybertronian_(faction)" title="Cybertronian (faction)">Cybertronian Empire</a>.

<p>Hound helped fend off a Decepticon attack. He and the other Autobots then enjoyed an unusual lull in Decepticon activities for the next several days, only to find out they had been lulled into a false sense of security; the Decepticons had stolen the Autobots’ entire supply of fuel during this quiet time. Even as Windcharger headed out to fetch more fuel, Hound informed him it was too late; his radar detected that the Decepticons were already on their way. Hound and the other Autobots nonetheless attempted to fend off the Decepticons once more. Thankfully, Optimus returned just in time with a new shipment of fuel.

<p>Hound was among the Autobots who vowed to stop Decepticon activity on Earth. He and the other Autobots cheered so loudly at Optimus's proclamation that "Freedom was the right of all sentient beings" that they nearly caused a volcano to erupt. Later, Hound was involved in the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons that was a result of Megatron taking millions of humans hostage in a bid to get the Earth to surrender to the Decepticons. Hound participated both in the invasion of the Decepticons' base and the subsequent fight against The Devastator. The Autobots were eventually victorious, and Hound drove away with the rest of his comrades after Optimus declared the war between Autobots and Decepticons to be over. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Battle_for_Earth" title="Battle for Earth">Battle for Earth</a></span>

<p>When Optimus began to worry that Bumblebee failed to report in a timely manner while out on patrol, he dispatched Hound alongside Prowl and Swoop to check up on the little Autobot. When they met up with Bumblebee, who informed them of the Decepticon's ploy to destroy acres of farmland in order to starve humanity into submission, Hound suggested they headed back to Autobot headquarters immediately, in order to report back to Optimus. Doing so, however, led them straight into a violent storm, stranding them in the middle of nowhere and ending their adventure.
</p><p>Alternatively, if the small group of Autobots decided to try and stop the Decepticon plot on their own, they were surprised to find Buster Witwicky on the road. The boy informed them that his father had discovered a fatal flaw in Decepticon circuitry, from whom Sparkplug was now on the run from. If the Autobots decided not to postpone their current mission for Sparkplug's sake, they were ambushed and destroyed by the Decepticons.
</p><p>If they decided to rescue Buster's father, Hound and the Autobots drove into the mountains, they quickly discovered Sparkplug holed up in a cave surrounded by Decepticons. While Swoop flew ahead to distract the Decepticons, Hound and the rest of the earthbound Autobots met up with Sparkplug in his cave, and decided whether or not to make a stand against the Decepticons. Depending on some choices other bots made, Hound's battle to defend the cave alongside Bumblebee and Prowl was more or less difficult.
</p><p>In one version of the following events, Hound, Prowl, Bumblebee and the Witwickys fell to their deaths in an attempt to find an alternate route out of the cave.
</p><p>In another version of the subsequent events, Hound, Prowl and Bumblebee successfully held out against the Decepticons until Autobot reinforcements arrived to turn the tide of battle.
</p><p>In yet another version of these events, Hound successfully used his hologram gun to create a diversion, and allowed Prowl to make a mad dash back to Autobot headquarters with Sparkplug.
</p><p>In a completely different sequence of events, Hound was chosen along with Jazz, Prowl, Wheeljack, and Swoop by Optimus Prime to stop the Decepticon plot, when Bumblebee made it back to the Autobots' headquarters on his own. The group, joined by Bumblebee, was ambushed as soon as they arrived in the open countryside of the farmland. If <a href="/wiki/You" title="You">you</a> attempted to interfere, the Autobots were doomed. However, when the Autobots were left to their own devices, Hound and the rest of the group realized on their own that they had stumbled into a Decepticon trap. Whether or not the group made it back to their base depended on the decisions Optimus Prime made.<span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Battle_Drive" title="Battle Drive">Battle Drive</a></span>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Desert_Flight">Desert Flight</span></h4>
<p>Hound was part of a group of the Autobots’ best scouts, led by Optimus on a fuel-finding mission. When the convoy heard a large explosion in the distance, Optimus sent Cosmos to investigate the noise.
</p><p>If Cosmos radioed his findings to Optimus immediately, Optimus’s convoy moved in to investigate a nearby Decepticon base. En route, the Autobots passed near a human town, but began floating in mid-air before being able to reach it. Evidently, the phenomenon was caused by a Decepticon anti-gravity weapon.
</p><p>If Optimus ordered his troops to come to the humans’ aid, they found themselves taking part in a struggle in futility, as the entire town was near-weightless, meaning they couldn’t put the humans anywhere where they wouldn’t float away once more. Then, the Autobots heard Decepticons approaching. Helpless in their current position, the Autobots were quickly eradicated by the Decepticons.
</p><p>If Optimus ordered his troops to attack the Decepticon base, they soon reached an area free of the anti-gravity beam’s influence. They were then attacked by a small fleet of Decepticons. The Decepticons were quickly forced to break off their attack and retreated. But with the battle over, the Autobots noticed a small human boy at their feet. The Autobots then headed for the Decepticon base, with their stowaway. Megatron delivered an ultimatum; if the Autobots did not surrender Optimus Prime to the Decepticons immediately, he would use his gravity beam to have the nearby humans float off into space.
</p><p>If the Autobots decided to continue with their initial plan to simply attack the Decepticon base, their advance was halted by a force field. Megatron then fired his beam in all directions, causing a ripple effect that sent everything not fastened down to the Earth’s surface to float helplessly out into space.
</p><p>Alternatively, the Autobots could concoct a plan where Optimus would pretend to allow himself to be taken prisoner, per Buddy’s suggestion. In actuality, Hound and the rest of the Autobots were hidden away inside Optimus’s trailer. The Autobots then led a surprise attack on their unsuspecting foes.
</p><p>In the event that Buddy tampered with the gravity gun in the ensuing battle, the Autobots would emerge victorious.
</p><p>In the event that Buddy instead entered a space-time anomaly created throughout the course of the battle, the Autobots would lose their fight against the Decepticons, and Hound wound up either injured or dead.
</p><p>If Optimus destroyed the duplicate Cosmos, the real one would inform the Autobots of the Decepticons’ schemes, and the convoy would roll out to take on their adversaries. They were soon met by a squad of flying Decepticons, but were at a strict disadvantage against their adversaries as their vehicle modes possessed no weapons. The Autobots nonetheless managed to fight their way to the Decepticons’ base, one way or another, and defeated the Decepticons by using their own gravity weapon against them. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Desert_Flight" title="Desert Flight">Desert Flight</a></span>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Decepticon_Poison">Decepticon Poison</span></h4>
<p>In one possible scenario, Hound was amongst the troops that Optimus brought to the Decepticons’ poison lab, in order to foil the Decepticons’ plan of poisoning the humans’ nearby water supply.
</p><p>If the Autobots decided to launch a full-frontal assault, as suggested by Ironhide, Hound was one of the Autobots Optimus called forth to gun down the laboratory. The laboratory then caved in on itself, signalling an Autobot victory.
</p><p>Alternatively, if Optimus decided to send his troops to the water reservoir instead of the lab, Hound was amongst the group of Autobots that found the reservoir swarmed by Decepticons upon their arrival. In one possible sequence of events, Hound was killed by Megatron in the battle that ensued. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Decepticon_Poison" title="Decepticon Poison">Decepticon Poison</a></span>

<p>Hound was present at the Autobot city of Metroplex when an Autobot Alert sounded.
</p><p>He and the other Autobots learned of two Decepticon plots simultaneously occurring. One of which was the theft of a coded message meant for Ultra Magnus’s eyes only. If Ultra Magnus decided to prioritize theft of the coded message, Hound was part of the captive audience that listened to Kup divulge information about an ancient Autobot formula. Hound took off towards the Autobots’ desert research centre along with a number of other Autobots. Once there, they learned from Springer that the Cybertite sphere containing the formula was discovered by humans during the 16th century. If the Decepticons had decoded Springer's message, they would be searching off the coast of California, where the ship containing the sphere had sunk. If they hadn’t decoded the message, the Decepticons would still be digging in the nearby crater.
</p><p>If Ultra Magnus decided to assume that the Decepticons had already decrypted the message, he ordered his forces to split up to more efficiently address the situation. Hound was sent ahead to scout out the best route to the California coast. Catching up with Hound, Ultra Magnus’s troops were informed by Powerglide (who had flown ahead of the land-bound group) that he had discovered the location of the sunken ship containing the cybertite sphere. Simultaneously, Blurr caught up with the group to inform them that the Decepticons were quickly approaching. The Autobots then needed to decide whether they would raise the ship themselves, or try and ambush the Decepticons after they had done so. Whether the Autobots failed or succeeded from this point forward depended on the actions of other Autobots. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Autobot_Alert!" title="Autobot Alert!">Autobot Alert!</a></span>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Dreamwave_Generation_One_continuity">Dreamwave <i>Generation One</i> continuity</span></h3>
<p>After the death of <a href="/wiki/Sentinel_Prime_(G1)" title="Sentinel Prime (G1)">Sentinel Prime</a> and the fall of <a href="/wiki/Altihex" title="Altihex">Altihex</a>, Hound was one of several Autobots called upon by <a href="/wiki/Grimlock_(G1)" title="Grimlock (G1)">Grimlock</a> to meet with him in the ruins of <a href="/wiki/Praxus" title="Praxus">Praxus</a>. Here, Grimlock announced his plans to take command of the Autobots himself, by force if need be, should the next appointed Prime not prove to be capable of leading them in combat. The group attended the inauguration of Optronix into <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(G1)" title="Optimus Prime (G1)">Optimus Prime</a>, and when an enemy attempt was made against the new Prime, Hound helped fend off the assassins. He and <a href="/wiki/Kup_(G1)" title="Kup (G1)">Kup</a> gunned down <a href="/wiki/Backbite_(G1)" title="Backbite (G1)">Backbite</a>, causing him to explode spectacularly. Optimus then took care of the other assassins, winning several Autobots over... only to then announce that he planned a planet-wide evacuation. Hound was visibly shocked over this decision. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_War_Within_issue_1" title="The War Within issue 1">The War Within #1</a></span> Though hw helped in loading up the Autobots' shuttles needed for this exodus, Hound bemoaned the oath of allegiance he had long ago taken to the Autobots all the while, and talked with Ironhide over how... wrong the evacuation felt. Grimlock chimed in as well, reiterating his doubts over Prime's ability to head the Autobots. Though Grimlock stormed off, Hound and the rest of his team remained to continue at their task. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_War_Within_issue_2" title="The War Within issue 2">The War Within #2</a></span> Shortly after this transpired, Megatron and Optimus were fed visions of the future through the Matrix of Leadership. In one of these visions, they witnessed Hound help defend a hydro-electric dam from a Decepticon attack on Earth. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_War_Within_issue_5" title="The War Within issue 5">The War Within #5</a></span>
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Great_War_(G1)" title="Great War (G1)">Great War</a>, when Prime disappeared and the Autobots fractioned into several smaller armies, Hound remained with the primary Autobot faction under <a href="/wiki/Prowl_(G1)" title="Prowl (G1)">Prowl</a>'s leadership. He reported the bad news that the Decepticons' new <a href="/wiki/Trypticon_(G1)" title="Trypticon (G1)">assault base</a> was almost operational. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Fragmentation_(G1)" title="Fragmentation (G1)">Fragmentation</a></span> This information proved slightly out of date; Trypticon was not only already operational, but battle-ready. When the giant Decepticon proved too much for Prowl's team to handle, Hound rustled up some reinforcements and lent a hand. Everything the Autobots threw at their enemy still wasn't enough to even slow it down however, and the Autobots only managed to survive the encounter because Trypticon was called away mid-battle. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Revelation_(The_Dark_Ages)" title="Revelation (The Dark Ages)">Revelation</a></span> Hound's group returned to base for repairs, only to come under attack by <a href="/wiki/The_Fallen" title="The Fallen">The Fallen</a>. The ancient Transformer broke into the Autobots' holding cells, reappropriated <a href="/wiki/Blitzwing_(G1)" title="Blitzwing (G1)">Blitzwing</a> from one of them, and then took off. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Confrontation_(issue)" title="Confrontation (issue)">Confrontation</a></span> It was Shockwave's Decepticons who wound up tracking down The Fallen to his base of operations, information that was conveyed back to Hound and the Autobots by <a href="/wiki/Swoop_(G1)" title="Swoop (G1)">Swoop</a>. Though the opposing factions joined forces to put an end to The Fallen's machinations, Hound was not among the soldiers who arrived on the battlefield in time to see any action. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Conflagration" title="Conflagration">Conflagration</a></span>
</p><p>Afterwards, <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Magnus_(G1)" title="Ultra Magnus (G1)">Ultra Magnus</a> managed to unite the Autobots once more, and under his leadership gained a significant hold over Cybertron's resources and territories. This eventually forced the <a href="/wiki/Ultracon" title="Ultracon">Ultracons</a> and Shockwave's Decepticons to sign a peace treaty with the Autobots. Hound was in attendance at the ceremony, which was interrupted by a bombing engineered by Starscream and his <a href="/wiki/Predacon_(War_Within)" title="Predacon (War Within)">Predacons</a>. This attack only served to strengthen the alliance between the factions, and they struck back as a united front against the aggressors. However, the dramatic return of Megatron with his cloned <a href="/wiki/Air_Warrior" title="Air Warrior">Aerospace Extermination Squadron</a> ended any ideas of truce whatsoever. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Age_of_Wrath" title="The Age of Wrath">The Age of Wrath</a></span> Megatron quickly took over the planet, and enslaved the majority of Autobots. Hound was among the many unfortunates captured, and put to work in <a href="/wiki/Internment_Camp_Pi" title="Internment Camp Pi">Internment Camp Pi</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Age_of_Wrath_Pt.2" title="The Age of Wrath Pt.2">The Age of Wrath Pt.2</a></span>
</p>
<div class="tt1_graynote"><i>The Age of Wrath</i> ceased publication before the story could conclude. The following would have taken place in unpublished issues.</div>
<p>Optimus returned to Cybertron, and the Autobots were freed from slavery. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Age_of_Wrath_Pt.6" title="The Age of Wrath Pt.6">The Age of Wrath Pt.6</a></span>
</p><p>Later still (and four million years ago), Hound was part of the crew of the Ark spaceship, and crashlanded on the planet Earth after a conflict with the Decepticons. The Autobots and Decepticons on board remained in <a href="/wiki/Stasis_lock" title="Stasis lock">stasis lock</a>, buried at the base of <a href="/wiki/Mount_St._Hilary" title="Mount St. Hilary">Mount St. Hilary</a> in Oregon, until the volcano exploded in <a href="/wiki/1984" title="1984">1984</a>, freeing them. Hound and the other Autobots under Prime's command waged war against the Decepticons on Earth, until finally capturing them all. Roughly a decade after they arrived, the Autobots planned to return to Cybertron with their prisoners aboard the <i><a href="/wiki/Ark_II" title="Ark II">Ark II</a></i>. Tragically, however, sabotage led to the spaceship exploding on its maiden voyage, and all aboard were believed dead. 
</p><p>Not so. In fact, a human mercenary named <a href="/wiki/Lazarus" title="Lazarus">Lazarus</a> had recovered a great number of the Transformers that had been on board, including Hound. He went to work on these deactivated robots, installing programming directives that would turn the Cybertronians into mindless drones for his own purposes. In <a href="/wiki/2002" title="2002">2002</a>, Hound was repurposed as Lazarus' transport jeep when he entertained the "freedom fighter" <a href="/wiki/Bishop_(human)" title="Bishop (human)">Bishop</a>, and stood guard against anybody following them. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_1" title="Prime Directive issue 1">Prime Directive #1</a></span> Lazarus was prepared to unleash his robot soldiers on the world, only to fail at the starting gate when Megatron reasserted control over his own programming and resumed the war. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_2" title="Prime Directive issue 2">Prime Directive #2</a></span> Hound, along with the other Autobots Lazarus had salvaged, were used to power Megatron's latest doomsday weapon: a metallic virus that would cyber-form the planet into a new Cybertron. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_3" title="Prime Directive issue 3">Prime Directive #3</a></span> The Decepticons soon after left to attack San Francisco, allowing Hound's allies to extract him from the machinery powering the virus. As he looked him over, <a href="/wiki/Sideswipe_(G1)" title="Sideswipe (G1)">Sideswipe</a> reported that Hound was alive, although he had been left in a barely functional state. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_4" title="Prime Directive issue 4">Prime Directive #4</a></span>
</p><p>Not long thereafter, Hound and the Autobots were entrenched against the Decepticons in <a href="/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> when they were confronted with an envoy from Cybertron, which had apparently ended the war sometime ago, creating a Unified Cybertronian government. <a href="/wiki/Shockwave_(G1)" title="Shockwave (G1)">Shockwave</a>, leader of this new regime, demanded the Autobots surrender themselves as war criminals. The Autobots escaped from his troops' clutches, and Hound was sent out as part of a scouting party to gather more information on the newcomers. While out on their patrol, they were ambushed and approached by a team headed by <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Magnus_(G1)" title="Ultra Magnus (G1)">Ultra Magnus</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/New_World_Order" title="New World Order">New World Order</a></span> Allegedly in order to prevent the warlike Transformers of Earth from igniting old passions, Hound and many of his fellow Autobots were captured by this group. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Brothers%27_Burden" title="Brothers' Burden">Brothers' Burden</a></span> Brought back to Cybertron aboard <a href="/wiki/Sky_Lynx_(G1)" title="Sky Lynx (G1)">Sky Lynx</a>, Hound and the Autobots were removed from their prison cells by the <a href="/wiki/Triple_Changer" title="Triple Changer">Triple Changer</a> named <a href="/wiki/Broadside_(G1)" title="Broadside (G1)">Broadside</a>, and brought into contact with a resistance cell led by <a href="/wiki/Smokescreen_(G1)" title="Smokescreen (G1)">Smokescreen</a>. It seemed Shockwave actually had a hidden agenda (of course), and many Autobots had begun taking up arms again to fight back against his regime. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Passive_Aggression" title="Passive Aggression">Passive Aggression</a></span> Hound joined in the insurrection at <a href="/wiki/Iacon_(polity)" title="Iacon (polity)">Iacon</a>, and the resistance ultimately pushed Shockwave out of command, retaking Cybertron for the Autobots. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/War_and_Peace" title="War and Peace">War and Peace</a></span>
</p><p>As Ultra Magnus began re-establishing Autobot control over the planet, Prowl decided that Hound and the rest of the Ark's crew would be best served by returning to Earth and establishing a permanent base of operations there. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Original_Sin" title="Original Sin">Original Sin</a></span> Being the Earth-lover that he was, Hound was all for the idea. Several others objected, unwilling to leave Cybertron after returning to it for such a brief period of time, but Hound reminded them that they had responsibilities towards their human friends. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Atonement" title="Atonement">Atonement</a></span> As the Autobots blasted off from Cybertron, Hound looked over a display of Earth on their ship's bridge. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Lost_and_Found_(issue)" title="Lost and Found (issue)">Lost and Found</a></span>
</p><p>Hound was last seen at the site of the future <a href="/wiki/Autobot_City_(G1)" title="Autobot City (G1)">Autobot City</a>, using his holograms to help <a href="/wiki/Grapple_(G1)" title="Grapple (G1)">Grapple</a> visualize his plans for the city. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Route_of_All_Evil" title="The Route of All Evil">The Route of All Evil</a></span>

<p>Sergeant Hound was one of the policebots who pursued the criminal <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(Movie)" title="Megatron (Movie)">C-81</a> and his band of miscreants after one of their botched raids. With the assistance of fellow officers <a href="/wiki/Strongarm_(RID)" title="Strongarm (RID)">Strongarm</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prowl_(RID)" title="Prowl (RID)">Prowl</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prowl_II" title="Prowl II">Prowl</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ransack_(Cybertron)" title="Ransack (Cybertron)">Ransack</a>, Sergeant Hound managed to corner the group of Cybertron's most wanted in <a href="/wiki/Seeker-Shinai" title="Seeker-Shinai">Seeker-Shinai</a>. During the arrest, Hound noted that a nearby Seeker recognized that C-81 was a "Megatron". Hound was skeptical of this claim, but nonetheless reported the comment to his superiors after bringing the criminals to the Offworlder maximum security prison.
</p><p>Later the same day, the TransTechs ceased functioning on a planet-wide scale. Sergeant Hound and General Optimus Prime had to deal with the ensuing chaos. Thankfully, the prison was still (mostly) secured, and Sergeant Hound was content to allow the prisoners fight it out amongst themselves to tucker them out. The Sergeant and the General went off to investigate the source of the shutdown. They soon discovered the source of the problem: a nest of <a href="/wiki/Waruder" title="Waruder">Waruder</a> invaders deep within Axiom Nexus's underground network.
</p><p>Arriving at the nest, Hound and Optimus found a battle already in progress between the Waruders and the group of escaped criminals led by C-81. The Cybertronians were soon joined by <a href="/wiki/Lift-Ticket_(Diaclone)" title="Lift-Ticket (Diaclone)">Lift-Ticket</a> and <a href="/wiki/Burn_Out" title="Burn Out">Burn Out</a>, the latter of which impressed Hound thoroughly with her heavy armament and precision aim. Despite these reinforcements, Hound and company found themselves on the losing side of the battle. Thankfully, C-81 managed to grab a hold of the Waruders' <a href="/wiki/Beet-Chit" title="Beet-Chit">leader</a> and forced him into peaceful negotiations. The discussion ended with an agreement that the Waruders would be allowed safe passage to a deserted Cybertron. As the invaders migrated via C-81's interuniversal gate, the Sergeant conversed with Burn Out's pilot, <a href="/wiki/Dia" title="Dia">Dia</a>, and explained to her the circumstances that led to the Waruders building such an evolved and dangerous hive. Sergeant Hound and General Optimus Prime then allowed C-81's band to "slip away" as a way of thanking them for their part in thwarting the Waruder invasion. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Cybertron%27s_Most_Wanted" title="Cybertron's Most Wanted">Cybertron's Most Wanted</a></span>

<ul><li>The Hound toy was originally a <i><a href="/wiki/Diaclone" title="Diaclone">Diaclone</a></i> "J59 Jeep", coming with a blue-and-white pilot figure and several IP-infringing decals.
</li><li>Ken Sansom's voice for Hound sounds not unlike famous actor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(actor)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:James Stewart (actor)">Jimmy Stewart</a>.
</li><li>Due to the <a href="/wiki/Character_model" title="Character model">animation model</a> of the character being based on <a href="/wiki/Package_art" title="Package art">package art</a> as much as the actual toy, Hound's holographic rifle was misinterpreted as a small pistol thanks to the foreshortening used. The Alternators toy uses the "pistol", which led people more familiar with the original figure's gigantic rifle to quip that his new weapon was "far too small".
</li><li>Hound's head design has several elements that alternate frequently between two different interpretations among the various toys and art renditions: On the original toy, the center of his helmet sports a raised ridge that's only slightly indented compared to the sides of the helmet on the front end. The animation model, based on the toy's package art that depicts the section in question in a way that's open to misinterpretation, changes that to an <i>entirely</i> indented middle section of the helmet <i>without</i> a ridge. Since then, comic book artists have mostly followed the animation model, with the exception of <a href="/wiki/Don_Figueroa" title="Don Figueroa">Don Figueroa</a> (<a href="/wiki/Transformers:_The_War_Within" title="Transformers: The War Within"><i>The War Within</i> volume 1</a> and IDW's <a href="/wiki/The_Transformers_(IDW)" title="The Transformers (IDW)">ongoing title</a>, the latter drawn in his new "live action movie"-inspired style) and <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Wildman" title="Andrew Wildman">Andrew Wildman</a> (<a href="/wiki/Transformers:_War_Within:_The_Dark_Ages" title="Transformers: War Within: The Dark Ages"><i>The War Within</i> volume 2</a>). The toys (<i><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Alternators" title="Transformers: Alternators">Alternators</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Universe_(2008_toyline)" title="Transformers: Universe (2008 toyline)">Universe</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Legends_Class_(2005)" title="Legends Class (2005)">Legends Class</a>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Robot_Heroes_(toyline)" title="Robot Heroes (toyline)">Robot Heroes</a></i> figures) have mostly remained faithful to the original toy, with the exception of the <i>Universe</i> Deluxe Class toy. In addition, the usually raised "earmuff" sections on the sides of the helmet, which were <i>indented</i> on the original toy, alternate heavily between "round" and "squared", sometimes even between different comics drawn by the same artist (notably <a href="/wiki/E._J._Su" title="E. J. Su">E. J. Su</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guido_Guidi" title="Guido Guidi">Guido Guidi</a>).
</li><li>Like those of many Generation 1 characters, Hound's animation model has appeared as an unnamed cameo in the <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Armada_(cartoon)" title="Transformers: Armada (cartoon)"><i>Armada</i> cartoon</a>. He is visible both reacting to the <a href="/wiki/Mini-Con" title="Mini-Con">Mini-Con</a> beacon alongside <a href="/wiki/Braver" title="Braver">Braver</a> and <a href="/wiki/Road_King" title="Road King">Road King</a> in "<a href="/wiki/First_Encounter" title="First Encounter">First Encounter</a>" (seen at right), and in a flashback in "<a href="/wiki/Prehistory" title="Prehistory">Prehistory</a>".
